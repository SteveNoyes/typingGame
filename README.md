### Useful resources

- [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - I use this for most projects to start with a 'clean' area to build.  

- [Text & Word Spacing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_spacing.asp) - Still didn't get this pixel perfect to my spec. but I think it works.

- [Changing Image at Media Query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2182716/is-it-possible-to-set-the-equivalent-of-a-src-attribute-of-an-img-tag-in-css) - Changing at media query was something I went back and forth on. I ended up copying everything and remaking it desktop first and then merged the two.
